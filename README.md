## About

This project is based on the refactoring of CrepeSR, replace mongodb with sqlite,use ES Modules, use FP instead of OOP whenever possible, and refactor code to be as clean as possible.

This project is only an experimental project for me to learn node, most of the features are still under active development and may be terminated or refactored significantly at any time.

Originally, the ORM framework I wanted to use prisma, but found that it does not support any type qualification of json fields, so currently I use typeorm to develop.

If it goes well, I will try to implement a plugin system and a create-plugin npm package.
